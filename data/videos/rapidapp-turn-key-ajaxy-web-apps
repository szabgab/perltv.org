__DESCRIPTION__

Overview and live demonstration of the RapidApp web framework (www.rapidapp.info) which provides turn-key web interfaces (Web 2.0/AJAX using ExtJS) that tie automatically into various backend data models.

The primary focus of RapidApp is on DBIx::Class databases, with full CRUD capabilities, understanding of underlying column types, foreign keys and relationships, etc., but there is also built-in support for templating, CMS, authentication and permissions, saved views, reports and so on.

RapidApp provides a high-level declarative syntax to create fully working apps in just a few lines of code but still provides full access to the Catalyst development stack for extension and customization (TIMTOWTDI).

In addition to covering the basics of the RapidApp APIs, several example demo applications will be shown, including creating a new app from scratch, **live**, during the presentation.

Additional existing applications with different use-cases will also be shown, each with full working source-code available on GitHub:

github.com/vanstyn/BlueBox
github.com/IntelliTree/RA-SmsArc
github.com/IntelliTree/RA-ChinookDemo
github.com/vanstyn/MimeCas
github.com/IntelliTree/RA-InfoSite

RapidApp was shown in a lightning talk last year: http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/talk/4863

Much progress has been made since then including public release on GitHub/CPAN and launch of the project website with some video demos: www.rapidapp.info
