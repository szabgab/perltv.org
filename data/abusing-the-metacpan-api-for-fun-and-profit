__DESCRIPTION__

[MetaCPAN](http://metacpan.org/) aims to make it fun and easy to
get data about CPAN modules, distributions, favourites and even CPAN authors themselves,
but sometimes it's just not easy enough. This talk will show you how to avoid
some of the pitfalls of working with the MetaCPAN API,
creating ElasticSearch queries and building your own MetaCPAN powered application.
Some sample code will be made available prior to the talk for any who'd like to review
it ahead of time, but it's by no means compulsory for attendance.
The links to some prep code and slides are posted at
[blogs.perl.org](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2013/06/abusing-the-metacpan-api-for-fun-and-profit-v2013.html)

The aim of this session is to arm both MetaCPAN beginners and intermediate users
with enough knowledge to build the next MetaCPAN-powered web app, mobile app or
even contribute back to MetaCPAN itself.

[original](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/talk/4663) talk announcement.



Tha architecture of MetaCPAN: it uses
[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) and
[Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/) as a thin wrapper.

++ on MetaCPAN is favoriting a distribution, even when it is shown on the page of a module.

Endpoints
---------

Two different types of endpoints: convenience endpoints and ElasticSearch endpoints.
There is some overlap though.
Every type in the system has a corresponding endpoint. You've got
distributions, modules, releases, favorites, etc, but not every endpoint has a corresponding type.

Convenience Endpoints
---------------------

* [/author/DOY](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/author/DOY) - get the author record that has this ID
* [/distribution/Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/distribution/Moose)
* [/release/Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/release/Moose)
* [/module/Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/module/Moose)
* [/pod/Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/pod/Moose)
* [/search/autocomplete?q=Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/search/autocomplete?q=Moose)  (JSON reply)
* [/search/reverse_dependencies/Moose](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/search/reverse_dependencies/Moose)

There are actually no module and pod types.
The above will retrieve the latest authorized verison of Moose.

Versioned Convenience Endpoints
-------------------------------

You might want a specific version of Moose:

* [/release/DOY/Moose-2.0001](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/release/DOY/Moose-2.0001)
* [/module/DOY/Moose-2.0001/lib/Moose.pm](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/module/DOY/Moose-2.0001/lib/Moose.pm)
* [/pod/DOY/Moose-2.0001/lib/Moose.pm](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/pod/DOY/Moose-2.0001/lib/Moose.pm)
* [/search/reverse_dependencies/DOY/Moose-2.0001](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/search/reverse_dependencies/DOY/Moose-2.0001)


GET /pod

Don't send JSON in your request. Don't expect JSON in your response.

By default it sends back HTML. You can pass a content-type in the query parameter:

* [/pod/Moose?content-type=text/plain](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/pod/Moose?content-type=text/plain)
* [/pod/Moose?content-type=text/x-markdown](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/pod/Moose?content-type=text/x-markdown)

Or send a content-type header.

The easy way to do it is to use the
[MetaCPAN::API::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/module/MetaCPAN::API::Tiny) module.

The (real) Endpoints
--------------------

* /author
* /distribution
* /favorite
* /file
* /rating
* /release

A module is a file.

The user endpoint
------------------

* [/user](https://api.metacpan.org/v0/user)

You need to be logged in and you need to use https!

MetaCPAN Explorer
-----------------

[MetaCPAN Explorer](http://explorer.metacpan.org/)

* [/author/OALDERS](https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS) (the html result page)
* [Explorer](http://explorer.metacpan.org/?url=/author/OALDERS)
* [/author/OALDERS](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/author/OALDERS)  (the API result)
* [/author](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/author) (the first few authors)
* [/author/_mapping](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/author/_mapping)
* [/author/_search](http://api.metacpan.org/v0/author/_search) (the first 10 results)
* [MetaCPAN::Document::Author](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/blob/master/lib/MetaCPAN/Document/Author.pm) (the source code)


Enable compression
------------------

* [WWW::Mechanize::Gzip](http://metacpan.org/module/WWW::Mechanize::Gzip)
* [WWW::Mechanize::Cached::Gzip](http://metacpan.org/module/WWW::Mechanize::Cached::Gzip)
* Or set the appropriate  Accept: gzip request header

Scrolling request
------------------

Send a query that will calculate the results and give an id back. Then use that id
to fetch parts of the result. (The result set is normally limited to 5,000 entries.)
The [ElasticSearch](https://metacpan.org/module/ElasticSearch) module abstracts this away.

Query vs filter
----------------

Use a query if you need to sort your results by relevance.

Generally you want to use a filter. (e.g. all the distributions on CPAN)

Filters use less resources and are faster.

Code Examples

Hack on MetaCPAN
-----------------

* Download the pre-configured VM
* Require VirtualBox + Vagrant
* See more details on [GitHub](https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-developer)
